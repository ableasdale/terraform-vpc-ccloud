## New Project

```bash
terraform init
```

You should see:

```
Terraform initialized in an empty directory!

The directory has no Terraform configuration files. You may begin working
with Terraform immediately by creating Terraform configuration files.
```


Initialize Terraform in the /terraform directory.

terraform init
Create a plan.

terraform plan
Apply the whole thing!

terraform apply -auto-approve
Note: the -auto-approve flag automagically accepts the implicit plan created by apply.
